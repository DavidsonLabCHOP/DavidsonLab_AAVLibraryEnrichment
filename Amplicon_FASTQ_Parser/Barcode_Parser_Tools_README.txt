The read structure of the Illumina amplicon sequencing data analyzed in the article associated with this GitHub is unique to the constructs used in the
peptide-modified AAV screens performed by the Davidson laboratory.

To enable the barcode parsing tools provided here to be useful beyond that one specific context, the code provided here has been flexibly designed to allow 
for general processing of amplicon-based Illumina screening data with fixed-position barcodes.

The sequencing data used to perform the screens in the article associated with this GitHub repository can be acquired from the authors upon reasonable request and
will be made available in accordance with The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia’s institutional policies
